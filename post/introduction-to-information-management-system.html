                   In this short post, we aim to explore the field of business informatics — the discipline that studies the application of information technology
                   to companies and the impact of IT on the various components that make up the business system. 
                   In just a few lines, we will provide an overview of the different areas within a information management system and 
                   how they can work together to improve overall efficiency. 
                   Additionally, we'll take a brief look at emerging technologies and potential future developments in the field.

                    <!--Company structure and Information System-->
                    
                    <!--How and Information System is developed-->


                    <!--A distinction between Operational Systems and Information System-->
                    ERPs are systems that originated and developed primarily within the manufacturing industry. 
                    They are designed to meet the practical needs of businesses, such as transaction recording, planning and control, knowledge acquisition and organization, 
                    as well as the management and coordination of business production processes.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <!--Operational System and its component-->
                    An ERP system is essentially structured around the administrative area, logistics, sales or commercial area, purchasing, production, and additionally includes some complementary systems.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <!--ERP: Administrative Area-->
                    The administrative area is responsible for managing the company's accounting, financial, and VAT transactions. 
                    The main data it works with includes: the chart of accounts, the list of customers, the list of suppliers, 
                    and the financial institutions the company works with.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <!--ERP: Logistic Area-->
                    The logistics area is responsible for tracking all material movements within the warehouse. 
                    It works with item master data, the company layout (i.e., the logical organization of the warehouse), 
                    and must keep track of what is being moved, when it is moved, where it is moved, in what quantity, how it is moved, and why.

                    <!--ERP: Marketing Area-->
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The sales area and the purchasing area are symmetrical in many respects.

                    <br>
                    The sales or commercial area of a company is responsible for managing sales and customer relations. 
                    It primarily works with the commercial master data of customers and sales products, 
                    as well as with data structures that define price lists, discount schemes, and agency agreements. 
                    This area mainly handles process plans, such as shipping and invoicing schedules.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <!--ERP: Buyers Area-->
                    The purchasing area is responsible for tracking all purchases made on behalf of the company. 
                    The main data it works with includes purchase products, material and service suppliers, the company's price lists, and discount lists. 
                    The purchasing department also manages purchase orders along with the related process documents and invoices.

                    <!--ERP: Productive Area-->
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A production management system is responsible for overseeing the company's manufacturing processes. 
                    The key data it operates on includes the master data structures that define a product's components and 
                    the related operations (the so-called bill of materials and work orders), the estimated and actual production costs, 
                    and the data structures that encode the production process along with the related material and labor requirements.

                    <!--Complementary Systems-->
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Additional systems may be necessary for better management of the company. 
                    These can include systems dedicated to product quality control, personnel management, 
                    or even tracking research and innovation activities within the company. 
                    New systems can integrate emerging technologies such as IoT (Internet of Things) 
                    for more precise monitoring of processes or machinery health, 
                    or cost-reduction strategies through the use of Cloud technologies, 
                    as opposed to traditional on-premise computing solutions.
                    Mobile technologies and related apps could also be employed for constant monitoring and updating of the company's status. 
                    Among the most widespread and pervasive technologies today, artificial intelligence certainly stands out, 
                    finding broad applications in this field—for example, in automating and optimizing production processes.
