                    Introduction to Marketing
                    what is marketing

                    <!--what is marketing-->
                    <p>
                        Marketing is the art of making money satisfying the customer needs.
                    </p>

                    customer behavior

                    <!--what is market reasearch-->
                    <p>
                        Market research is the operation to gain insight and information on customer need in some particular  market.
                        This can be done by using interviews, focus groups or by secondary research.
                    </p>

                    <!--Segmentation, targeting and positioning-->

                    <!--Segmentation-->
                    <p>
                        Segmentation is the act of clustering or indentify groups in a certain market.
                        
                        We make a distinction between segmenting consumer markets and segmenting organizational market. 
                        The former one is dedicated to B2C business, the latter is dedicated to B2B business.

                        In every of the two case we can identify segmentation criteria useful for our purposes.

                        For consumer market we can have Behavioural parameters, Psychographic parameters and Profile parameters.

                        For organizational market we have the organizational size, the kind of industry, the geographic location, the choice criteria, the purchasing organization.

                        To evaluate the accuracy of the segmentation of the market, there are five criteria that someone can folllow:
                        the segmentation should effective, measurable, accessible, actionable and profitable.
                    
                        Effective means that intra-group similarity is maximized and extra-group similarity is minimized.

                        Measurable means that it's possible to measure differences and parameters inside the segment.

                        Accessible means that the company or the bussiness is able to formulate effective marketing programmes for the segment that they have chosen.

                        Actionable means that the company have the resource and the knowledge to serve a certain segment.

                        Profitable means that the segment is large enough to make profit by serving it. Some segment could be so small to not be sustainable for the company.
                    </p>

                    <!--Targeting-->
                    <p>
                        Targeting is the operation of choosing one or more segment of the market, to make business profitable and actionable.
                    </p>

                    <!--Positioning-->
                    <p>
                        Positioning is the act of design the company's offering so that it occupies a meaningful and distinct position in the target customer's mind.
                        
                        Deciding what position to try to occupy in the market require the consideration of three variables: customers, competitors and the company itself.

                        Once the overall positioning strategy is agreed, the next step is to develop a position statement.
                        The position statement should follow four criteria: clarity, consistency, credibility and competitiveness.

                        Clarity means that the idea must be perfectly clear to the customer, both in terms of target market and differential advantage.

                        Consistency means durability across time.

                        Creidibility means that the selected differential advantage must be credible  in the minds of the target customers.

                        Competitivness means that choose your own product have a significant value on the offerings with respect to competition.

                        Sometimes due to poor sales performance, a product or service will need to be repositioned. Repositioning involves changing the target markets, the differential advantage, or both.

                        There can be outlined different repositioned strategies based on the Product differentiation and/or the Target market.

                        We can have: Image Repositioning (if we have same product and same target market), Product repositioning (if we have Different Product, Same Target Market),
                        Intangible repositioning (if we have Same Product and differet Target Market ), Tangible Repositioning (if we have Different Product and Different Target Market).

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Segmentation is the act of clustering or indentify groups in a certain market. 

                        Targeting is the operation of choosing one or more segment of the market, to make business profitable and actionable.

                        Positioning is the act of differentiating a product from his competitors.
                    </p>

                    <!--Value through Product-->
                    <p>
                        A product is anything that can be exchanged by money.

                        <!-- Tangible or Untangible -->
                        There is a distinction between product and services that is the property of tangibility.
                        The product is more tangible than the service, but there is no clear distinction between the 
                        former and the latter, because there is always a part of untangible service in process 
                        (like the Apple buyer experience or the Ferrari process of product customization) and 
                        there is always a part of tangible product in a service (like in psychoterapy,
                        maybe the most untagible process, the tangible part of the service is in fact the setting in which it is delivered).
                    </p>

                    <!--Product differentiation-->
                    <p>
                        For every product you can delivery there is always a distinction between the core functionality 
                        of the product, the actual product and the external product.
                        For every of this aspect of the product, you can make a difference from the competitions.
                    </p>

                    <!--Branding-->
                    <p>
                        With branding it is mean the identification of the product. It is what you feel in your gut when you hear the name of a particular product or company.
                        In a more scientifically way, suppose of doing a test (called the blind test) like this: let's have two product, 
                        that are technically identical and also from an exterior perspective, but they come from different company, let's A and B: 
                        if you choose A, instead of B, that's where branding come out.
                    </p>

                    <!--Value Through Service-->
                    <p>
                        When you deliver a service there are always cue and fact that differentiate you from the competition.
