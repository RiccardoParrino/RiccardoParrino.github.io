                    Introduction to Marketing
                    what is marketing

                    <div class="marketing-introduction">

                        <!--what is marketing-->
                        <p class="what-is-marketing">
                            Marketing is the art of making money satisfying the customer needs.
                        </p>

                        <!--what is market reasearch-->
                        <p class="market-research">
                            Market research is the operation to gain insight and information on customer need in some particular  market.
                            This can be done by using interviews, focus groups or by secondary research.
                        </p>

                        <!--Segmentation, targeting and positioning-->

                        <!--Segmentation-->
                        <p class="segmentation">
                            Segmentation is the act of clustering or indentify groups in a certain market.
                            
                            We make a distinction between segmenting consumer markets and segmenting organizational market. 
                            The former one is dedicated to B2C business, the latter is dedicated to B2B business.

                            In every of the two case we can identify segmentation criteria useful for our purposes.

                            For consumer market we can have Behavioural parameters, Psychographic parameters and Profile parameters.

                            For organizational market we have the organizational size, the kind of industry, the geographic location, the choice criteria, the purchasing organization.

                            To evaluate the accuracy of the segmentation of the market, there are five criteria that someone can folllow:
                            the segmentation should effective, measurable, accessible, actionable and profitable.
                        
                            Effective means that intra-group similarity is maximized and extra-group similarity is minimized.

                            Measurable means that it's possible to measure differences and parameters inside the segment.

                            Accessible means that the company or the bussiness is able to formulate effective marketing programmes for the segment that they have chosen.

                            Actionable means that the company have the resource and the knowledge to serve a certain segment.

                            Profitable means that the segment is large enough to make profit by serving it. Some segment could be so small to not be sustainable for the company.
                        </p>

                        <!--Targeting-->
                        <p class="targeting">
                            Targeting refers to the choice of specific segments to serve.

                            There are four generic target marketing strategies: undifferentiated marketing, differentiated marketing, focused marketing and customized marketing.
                        
                            Undifferentiated marketing means an absence of segmentation. 
                            This strategy unfortunately can occur by default, and sometimes can be convenient by developing a single product/marketing strategy.

                            Differentiated marketing: differentiated marketing strategy for different segments of customer/organization.

                            Focused marketing: means a company develops a single marketing mix aimed at one target (niche) market.
                        
                            Customized marketing: means a company design a discrete marketing mix for each customer inside a segment.
                        </p>

                        <!--Positioning-->
                        <p class="positioning">
                            Positioning is the act of design the company's offering so that it occupies a meaningful and distinct position in the target customer's mind.
                            
                            Deciding what position to try to occupy in the market require the consideration of three variables: customers, competitors and the company itself.
                            Failure to gain a position in the customer's mind significantly increases the likelihood of being forgiven and consequently the failure in the marketplace.
                            As you can expect, offering something that customers are not interested in, means create a business that is not profitable. 

                            Once the overall positioning strategy is agreed, the next step is to develop a position statement.
                            The position statement should follow four criteria: clarity, consistency, credibility and competitiveness.

                            Clarity means that the idea must be perfectly clear to the customer, both in terms of target market and differential advantage.

                            Consistency means durability across time.

                            Creidibility means that the selected differential advantage must be credible  in the minds of the target customers.

                            Competitivness means that choose your own product have a significant value on the offerings with respect to competition.

                            Sometimes due to poor sales performance, a product or service will need to be repositioned. Repositioning involves changing the target markets, the differential advantage, or both.

                            There can be outlined different repositioned strategies based on the Product differentiation and/or the Target market.

                            We can have: Image Repositioning (if we have same product and same target market), Product repositioning (if we have Different Product, Same Target Market),
                            Intangible repositioning (if we have Same Product and differet Target Market ), Tangible Repositioning (if we have Different Product and Different Target Market).
                        </p>

                    </div>

                    <div class="value-through-product-service-price">
                        <div class="value-through-product">
                            <!--Value through Product-->
                            <p class="product">
                                A product is anything that can be exchanged by money.

                                <!-- Tangible or Untangible -->
                                There is a distinction between product and services that is the property of tangibility.
                                The product is more tangible than the service, but there is no clear distinction between the 
                                former and the latter, because there is always a part of untangible service in process 
                                (like the Apple buyer experience or the Ferrari process of product customization) and 
                                there is always a part of tangible product in a service (like in psychoterapy,
                                maybe the most untagible process, the tangible part of the service is in fact the setting in which it is delivered).
                            </p>

                            <!--Product differentiation-->
                            <p class="product-differentiation">
                                For every product you can delivery there is always a distinction between the core functionality 
                                of the product, the actual product and the external product.
                                For every of this aspect of the product, you can make a difference from the competitions.
                            </p>

                            <!--Branding-->
                            <p class="branding">
                                With branding it is mean the identification of the product. It is what you feel in your gut when you hear the name of a particular product or company.
                                In a more scientifically way, suppose of doing a test (called the blind test) like this: let's have two product, 
                                that are technically identical and also from an exterior perspective, but they come from different company, let's A and B: 
                                if you choose A, instead of B, that's where branding come out.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="value-through-services">
                            <div class="properties-of-services">
                                There are some properties of the services that distinguish them from product. These are:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Intangibility: Services are not tangible.</li>
                                    <li>Inseparability: Services are consumed in the same time they are producted, differently from product.</li>
                                    <li>Perishability: by the inseparability, services cannot be stored for the future. A hotel room or an airline seat not occupied today, represents lost that cannot be gained tomorrow.</li>
                                    <li>Variability: service quality may be subject to considerable variability.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </div>

                            <div class="managing-services-enterpises">
                                Managing services offering can be difficult and some advices in this cases can be given.
                                
                                By the difficult to evaluate beforehand a service, there are some important visual cues that customer uses (probably unconsciously) to determine or at least making an idea, of 
                                how much good is your offerings. These are some of the many.
                                
                                <div class="people">
                                    Make your room or studio clean and ordered, this is what they call servicescape.
                                    Make your employees motivated, satisfied, clean, well dressed, polite and clear speaker. The same apply for you.
                                    This is what they call Internal marketing.
                                </div>

                                <div class="process">
                                    The process can be divided into two parts: what is visible to the customer, what is not. Both of the two are important,
                                    we can say that the former is crucial for the service experience, meanwhile the latter is also critical for the overall quality of the service.

                                    Ok, now look at the quality of the service: there is a trade-off between the service quality and the service productivity.

                                    Service productivity is a measure of the relationship between an input and an output. 

                                    The point is: rise the productivity, keep high the quality of the service. 
                                    It's not a good thing, for example, for a doctor, to reduce the time of the consultation, rising the number of patient visited. 
                                    Find better, more effective strategy to this.
                                    
                                    As developer, for example, you can employ another framework in which you are more productive, or you can automatize some mechanical routine actions. 
                                    So do something, but it in a smart way.
                                </div>

                                <div class="service-branding">
                                    Of course for you service, choose a clear name and then word-of-mouth will do the rest of the work.
                                    A good name to be that, it should have: Distinctiveness, Relevance, Memorability and Flexibility.

                                    To make the quality of the service trustful and hopefully high, don't make these errors:

                                    Everything cannot go always in the right direction! What do you do when something unexpected happen?
                                    
                                    Ok, calm down, first of all, you cannot predict all of problems that can happen with a certain customer.

                                    The very firs step is to set a tracking system to identify system failures and a simple way for the customer to report a problem.

                                    Then learn about the solution and train your staff to recover when these happen.
                                    If something new unespected happens, again, you, your staff or the customer (but less responsible for that) should be engaged 
                                    in report, track, solve and store the problem, as frictionless as you can.

                                One of the best advice I got it from the book is: take care of the relationship with you customer. 

                                It's expensive (at least in time) for the customer to find another trustly provider, 
                                It's much more expensive for you to find a new customer instead of retaining the existing one.

                                Be kind with your customers, engage in a long-term relationship and take of them at the best you can.
                                
                                Precisely about that, I can suggest you some strategy to a better customer retention: 
                                one strategy can throughh financial incentives, like larger purchases, higher discounts, this is easy to be copied from the competitors, but it's effective;
                                the second strategy is customization of the service based on the customer needs, this second one advice is much more on the social side;
                                the third one is more about structural bonds: provide solutions to customers' problems that are design into service delivery system.

                            <div class="experiential-marketing">
                                Another important concept of delivering value through services is the experience of the customer.
                                
                                The service is not about only to the final product or solution, but also to the experience of the customer.

                                This is another aspect of the process that you can outline or taken care about.

                                Companies like Starbucks or Apple take really care about the experience of their customer making it unique.
