                    Introduction to Marketing
                    what is marketing

                    <!--what is marketing-->
                    <p>
                        Marketing is the art of making money satisfying the customer needs.
                    </p>


                    customer behavior

                    <!--what is market reasearch-->
                    <p>
                        Market research is the operation to gain insight and information on customer need in some particular  market.
                        This can be done by using interviews, focus groups or by secondary research.
                    </p>

                    <!--Segmentation, targeting and positioning-->
                    <p>
                        Segmentation is the act of clustering or indentify groups in a certain market. 

                        Targeting is the operation of choosing one or more segment of the market, to make business profitable and actionable.

                        Positioning is the act of differentiating a product from his competitors.
                    </p>

                    <!--Value through Product-->
                    <p>
                        A product is anything that can be exchanged by money.

                        <!-- Tangible or Untangible -->
                        There is a distinction between product and services that is the property of tangibility.
                        The product is more tangible than the service, but there is no clear distinction between the 
                        former and the latter, because there is always a part of untangible service in process 
                        (like the Apple buyer experience or the Ferrari process of product customization) and 
                        there is always a part of tangible product in a service (like in psychoterapy,
                        maybe the most untagible process, the tangible part of the service is in fact the setting in which it is delivered).
                    </p>

                    <!--Product differentiation-->
                    <p>
                        For every product you can delivery there is always a distinction between the core functionality 
                        of the product, the actual product and the external product.
                        For every of this aspect of the product, you can make a difference from the competitions.
                    </p>

                    <!--Branding-->
                    <p>
                        With branding it is mean the identification of the product. It is what you feel in your gut when you hear the name of a particular product or company.
                        In a more scientifically way, suppose of doing a test (called the blind test) like this: let's have two product, 
                        that are technically identical and also from an exterior perspective, but they come from different company, let's A and B: 
                        if you choose A, instead of B, that's where branding come out.
                    </p>

                    <!--Value Through Service-->
                    <p>
                        When you deliver a service there are always cue and fact that differentiate you from the competition.
                    
                        <!--Service offerings and packaging-->

                        <!--Do you have the skills?-->
                        skill

                        <!--Service Branding-->

                        <!--Internal Marketing-->
                        <!--Visual cue of orderliness and cleanliness-->

                        <!--Service fault recovery-->
                        <!--Service fault forecast-->
                    </p>

                    At the end of the discussion, we can say that there are three different ways to inject dependencies 
                    into a class, but the most used one is the Class Injection. By this strategy, we can inject the dependencies 
                    in a really simple and intuitive way. For doing these, it's sufficient create the dependency (usually the service class), configure the Injector to know about this class,
                    and finally declare the dependencies on the receiving component, in the constructor for example.
