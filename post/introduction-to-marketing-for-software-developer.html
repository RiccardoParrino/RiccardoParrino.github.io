                    <!--what is marketing-->
                    Marketing is the art of making a profit satisfying the customer needs. 

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The first tool I would like you to talk about is the segmentation, targeting and positioning. 
                    These are fundamental tools that are precondition to the post analysis and operation, 
                    without these, nothing can happen. So, having said this, let's start talking about Segmentation.

                    <!--Segmentation, targeting and positioning-->

                    <!--Segmentation-->
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Segmentation is the act of clustering or indentify groups in a certain market.
                    We make a distinction between segmenting consumer markets and segmenting organizational market. 
                    The former one is dedicated to B2C business, the latter is dedicated to B2B business.
                    In every of the two case we can identify segmentation criteria useful for our purposes.
                    For consumer market we can have Behavioural parameters, Psychographic parameters and Profile parameters.
                    For organizational market we have the organizational size, the kind of industry, the geographic location, the choice criteria, the purchasing organization.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To evaluate the accuracy of the segmentation of the market, there are five criteria that someone can folllow:
                    the segmentation should effective, measurable, accessible, actionable and profitable.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Effective means that intra-group similarity is maximized and extra-group similarity is minimized.</li>
                        <li>Measurable means that it's possible to measure differences and parameters inside the segment.</li>
                        <li>Accessible means that the company or the bussiness is able to formulate effective marketing programmes for the segment that they have chosen.</li>
                        <li>Actionable means that the company have the resource and the knowledge to serve a certain segment.</li>
                        <li>Profitable means that the segment is large enough to make profit by serving it. Some segment could be so small to not be sustainable for the company.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <!--Targeting-->
                    Targeting refers to the choice of specific segments to serve.
                    There are four generic target marketing strategies: undifferentiated marketing, differentiated marketing, focused marketing and customized marketing.
                    Undifferentiated marketing means an absence of segmentation. 
                    This strategy unfortunately can occur by default, and sometimes can be convenient by developing a single product/marketing strategy.
                    Differentiated marketing: differentiated marketing strategy for different segments of customer/organization.
                    Focused marketing: means a company develops a single marketing mix aimed at one target (niche) market.
                    Customized marketing: means a company design a discrete marketing mix for each customer inside a segment.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <!--Positioning-->
                    Positioning is the act of design the company's offering so that it occupies a meaningful and distinct position in the target customer's mind.
                    Deciding what position to try to occupy in the market require the consideration of three variables: customers, competitors and the company itself.
                    Failure to gain a position in the customer's mind significantly increases the likelihood of being forgiven and consequently the failure in the marketplace.
                    As you can expect, offering something that customers are not interested in, means create a business that is not profitable. 
                    Once the overall positioning strategy is agreed, the next step is to develop a position statement.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The position statement should follow four criteria: clarity, consistency, credibility and competitiveness.
                    Clarity means that the idea must be perfectly clear to the customer, both in terms of target market and differential advantage.
                    Consistency means durability across time.
                    Credibility means that the selected differential advantage must be credible  in the minds of the target customers.
                    Competitivness means that choose your own product have a significant value on the offerings with respect to competition.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Sometimes due to poor sales performance, a product or service will need to be repositioned. Repositioning involves changing the target markets, the differential advantage, or both.
                    There can be outlined different repositioned strategies based on the Product differentiation and/or the Target market.
                    We can have: Image Repositioning (if we have same product and same target market), Product repositioning (if we have Different Product, Same Target Market),
                    Intangible repositioning (if we have Same Product and differet Target Market ), Tangible Repositioning (if we have Different Product and Different Target Market).

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <!--Value through Product-->
                    Now let's talk about what you can sell: a product. 
                    A product is anything that can be exchanged by money.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <!-- Tangible or Untangible -->
                    There is a distinction between product and services that is the property of tangibility.
                    The product is more tangible than the service, but there is no clear distinction between the 
                    former and the latter, because there is always a part of untangible service in process 
                    (like the Apple buyer experience or the Ferrari process of product customization) and 
                    there is always a part of tangible product in a service (like in psychoterapy,
                    maybe the most untagible process, the tangible part of the service is in fact the setting in which it is delivered).

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <!--Product differentiation-->
                    For every product you can delivery there is always a distinction between the core functionality 
                    of the product, the actual product and the external product.
                    For every of this aspect of the product, you can make a difference from the competitions.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <!--Branding-->
                    With branding it is mean the identification of the product. It is what you feel in your gut when you hear the name of a particular product or company.
                    In a more scientifically way, suppose of doing a test (called the blind test) like this: let's have two product, 
                    that are technically identical and also from an exterior perspective, but they come from different company, let's A and B: 
                    if you choose A, instead of B, that's where branding come out.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There are some properties of the services that distinguish them from product. These are:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Intangibility: Services are not tangible.</li>
                        <li>Inseparability: Services are consumed in the same time they are producted, differently from product.</li>
                        <li>Perishability: by the inseparability, services cannot be stored for the future. A hotel room or an airline seat not occupied today, represents lost that cannot be gained tomorrow.</li>
                        <li>Variability: service quality may be subject to considerable variability.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Managing services offering can be difficult and some advices in this cases can be given.
                    By the difficult to evaluate beforehand a service, there are some important visual cues that customer uses (probably unconsciously) to determine or at least making an idea, of 
                    how much good is your offerings. These are some of the many.
                    Make your room or studio clean and ordered, this is what they call servicescape.
                    Make your employees motivated, satisfied, clean, welldressed, polite and clear speaker. The same apply for you.
                    This is what they call Internal Marketing.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The process can be divided into two parts: what is visible to the customer, what is not. Both of the two are important,
                    we can say that the former is crucial for the service experience, meanwhile the latter is also critical for the overall quality of the service.

                    Ok, now look at the quality of the service: there is a trade-off between the service quality and the service productivity.

                    Service productivity is the relationship between input and output.
                    The goal is to increase productivity without compromising the quality of the service.
                    For example, it's not effective for a doctor to shorten consultation times just to see more patients — that would reduce the quality of care.
                    Instead, the focus should be on finding smarter, more effective strategies.
                    As a developer, this might mean using a framework you're more efficient with, or automating repetitive, mechanical tasks.
                    In short: improve, but do it smart.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Of course for your service, choose a clear name and then word-of-mouth will do the rest of the work.
                    A good name to be that, it should have: Distinctiveness, Relevance, Memorability and Flexibility.

                    To make the quality of the service trustful and hopefully high, don't make these errors:
                    <ul>
                        <li>State as clear as you can what is the result of your process and don't lie about it to get a new customer! (at the end of the process he'll be disappointed, for sure)</li>
                        <li>Do you have all of the necessary resources to delivery the service?</li>
                        <li>Do you have all of the knowledge and competence to delivery the service?</li>
                        <li>Don't overpromise in marketing communication: state what you can do in the necessary amout of time, even if you think it's not competitive with your landscape.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To rise the quality of your service, you need to understand and meet the customer expectations but
                    everything cannot go always in the right direction! What do you do when something unexpected happen?
                    
                    Ok, first of all, you cannot predict all of problems that can happen with a certain customer.

                    The very firs step is to set a tracking system to identify system failures and a simple way for the customer to report a problem.

                    Then learn about the solution and train your staff to recover when these happen.
                    If something new unespected happens, again, you, your staff or the customer (but less responsible for that) should be engaged 
                    in report, track, solve and store the problem, as frictionless as you can.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One of the best advice I got it from the book is: take care of the relationship with you customer. 

                    It's expensive (at least in time) for the customer to find another trustly provider, 
                    It's much more expensive for you to find a new customer instead of retaining the existing one.

                    Be kind with your customers, engage in a long-term relationship and take of them at the best you can.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Precisely about that, I can suggest you some strategy to a better customer retention: 
                    one strategy can throughh financial incentives, like larger purchases, higher discounts, this is easy to be copied from the competitors, but it's effective;
                    the second strategy is customization of the service based on the customer needs, this second one advice is much more on the social side;
                    the third one is more about structural bonds: provide solutions to customers' problems that are design into service delivery system.  

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Another important concept of delivering value through services is the experience of the customer.
                    The service is not about only to the final product or solution, but also to the experience of the customer.
                    This is another aspect of the process that you can outline or taken care about.
                    Companies like Starbucks or Apple take really care about the experience of their customer making it unique.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There are several way to set the price of your product/service. 
                    You can do it by following the cost-based strategy, following the competitor based strategy or based on the real economic value of your delivery.
                    The Cost-based pricing is a useful approach to price setting because it can give you an indication of the minimum price that needs to be charged in order to break even.
                    
                    Once we have calculated the relevant costs, it is necessary to estimate how many units we are likely to sell. Then apply the 10 per cent mark-up a price.

                    There is another strategy that you can apply to set the price of your service: follow the prices charged by your leading competitors.
                    In addition, you can also set the price, starting from the competitors and achieve the final value based on a competitive bidding process.

                    The last and probably the most effective way to price setting is the market-led pricing.
                    In this case you set the price of your product estimating the value of the product itself for the customer.

                    In brief, the more value a product gives compared to the competition, the higher the price that can be charged.
                    
                    A case of Market-led pricing is given by Zantac. Zantac produces drug for ulcer treatment, and the resulting superior revenues transformed Glaxo from a mid-sized UK company to a global powerhouse.

                    There are several different ways to reach out your potential customer. 
                    One way is to attract the customer by the content you can publish in some way.
                    The other way you can reach out you client is by directly connecting to them.
                    A third (new) way is to put in action the potential of the social media marketing.
                    Now we will discuss each of them in some details.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <!--In-Bound Marketing-->
                    Inbound Marketing is the marketing operations that attract customers by creating content and experience based on themselves.
                    As a software developer fundamentally you can write and speak through your communication channel. 
                    Your communication channels are essentially your blog, your social account, your youtube channel, podcast, books and conferences.
                    For sure, speaking in front of thousand of people is intimidating, but it's socially useful and economically rewarding.  

                    For your blog you can post:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Article about actual state of your field</li>
                        <li>Blog posts</li>
                        <li>Training guides</li>
                        <li>Relevant past experiences</li>
                    </ul>

                    For the sake of training you can publish:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Books</li>
                        <li>Little essay</li>
                        <li>Slides</li>
                        <li>Guides</li>
                        <li>Video tutorial</li>
                    </ul>

                    Speaking at conferences can enhance your visibility through the community as also through your potential customer,
                    and for example you can talk about the last book you publish or the last enhancement of a library you have made

                    Inside social media, you can post something more engaging or playful like:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Blog posts</li>
                        <li>News articles</li>
                        <li>Quotes</li>
                        <li>Tips and tricks</li>
                        <li>Humor</li>
                        <li>Engaging questions</li>
                        <li>Promotion for own stuff</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br>

                    <!--Out-Bound Marketing-->
                    Interruption marketing or outbound marketing is promoting a product through continues advertising, promotinos, public relations and sales.
                    <!--Types of interruption marketing-->

                    First of all, let's create a database marketing. Anyone need of it. Some time it can a real database to hitting, 
                    sometimes can be a CRM software (Customer Relationship Management) or sometimes, in the simplest of these, it can a simple excel file.
                    The important thing about all of these is the presence of names, addresses, telephone numbers, mail and transaction data.
                    Mail and telephone number can be used for direct mail and telemarketing campaign.
                    Then you can also target a specific segment or audience of you potetial customer, applying a customized strategy only to them.
                    Anyway, more articulated case can be formulated in case you have bigger business. For example you can store promotional information, transactional information, geodemographic information and so and so forth.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Direct marketing is the term that is used to describe the distribution of products, information and promotional benefits to target consumers through interactive communincaiont allowing response to be measured.
                    There is a list of method that you can employ, as direct mail, telemarketing, direct response advertising, catalogue marketing and so on and so forth.
                    Anyway, in this little tutorial you will talk about direct mail and telemarketing.
                    Before start sending email to your potential customer, is better to design the direct marketing strategy to apply. For doing, follow these simple steps:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Identify target audience</li>
                        <li>Set the objective of direct marketing campaigns: imporve sales and profits, acquire or retain customers, create awareness</li>
                        <li>Choose the media to be used</li>
                        <li>You should decide what to communicate (objectives, product benefits, target market analysis, offer being made), e.g. the creative content</li>
                        <li>Evaluate the results (usually involves metrics as: response rate, total sales, sales rate, enquiry rate)</li>
                    </ol>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A key factor in the effectiveness of a direct mail campaing is the quality of the mailing list. 
                    From the creative perspective, you should outline:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the right message, both textual and graphics, making the design responsive</li>
                        <li>Include a call-to-action button or section</li>
                        <li>Analizing the behaviour of the receiver whenever he opens the mail</li>
                    </ul>

                    Evaluating the performance of a single mail involves the monitoring of fundamentals KPI like:
                    <ul>
                        <li>CTR: Click-Through-Rate, e.g. the percentage of people that have clicked at least on one link inside the email</li>
                        <li>CTOR: the percentage of people that have clicked on the message through the total number of people that open the email</li>
                        <li>Conversion Rate: the percentage of people that actually buy something</li>
                        <li>Bounce Rate: the percentage of people that receive the email, but doesn't open the email</li>
                        <li>Unsubscribe: the percentage of people that don't want to listen from you anymore</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The other techniques I would like to share with you is the personal-selling. In this case you should go physically to the customer
                    and make you offer. This technique is in somewhat similar to the telemarketing, in either case you can talk directly with your customer.

                    Like also said in this video that I recommend to watch (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaNi0dntHfU&t), probably this is the most effective
                    and professional selling channel.

                    Anyway, before start doing cold-calling or personal selling, outline the following step to be prepared for the conversation:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preparation</li>
                        <li>The opening</li>
                        <li>Need and problem identification</li>
                        <li>Presentation and demonstration</li>
                        <li>Dealing with objections</li>
                        <li>Closing the sale</li>
                        <li>The follow-up</li>
                    </ul>
                    The steps explain by themselves.
